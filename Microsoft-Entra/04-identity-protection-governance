# Module 4: Describe the Identity Protection and Governance Capabilities of Microsoft Entra

---

##   What Is Identity Protection?

**Microsoft Entra ID Protection** detects potential vulnerabilities and signs of compromise using **risk-based policies and insights**.

### Identity Protection Capabilities:
- **Risk Detection**: Identifies risky sign-ins or risky users
- **Risk-Based Conditional Access**: Blocks or challenges access based on risk
- **Risk Investigation & Remediation**: Enables security teams to take action on detected risks

---

##   Risk Types

| Risk Type     | Description                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Sign-in Risk  | Likelihood that a specific sign-in attempt is compromised |
| User Risk     | Likelihood that a user's identity has been compromised    |

### Examples of Detected Risk:
- Atypical travel (login from two far-apart locations within short time)
- Anonymous IP addresses
- Malware-linked IPs
- Unfamiliar sign-in properties

---

##   Risk Policies

You can create policies that automatically respond to detected risks.

| Policy Type         | Example Action                             |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| User Risk Policy    | Force password reset                       |
| Sign-in Risk Policy | Require MFA or block access                |

> Example: If a sign-in appears risky, challenge the user with MFA. If the user risk is high, block access and prompt for password change.

##   What Is Identity Governance?

**Identity Governance** ensures the **right people have the right access to the right resources** at the right time â€” and only for as long as needed.

### Identity Governance Features:
1. **Access Reviews**
2. **Entitlement Management**
3. **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**

---

##   Access Reviews

Access reviews help organizations:
- Validate whether users still need access
- Automatically **remove outdated or unnecessary access**
- Stay compliant with industry standards

> Example: Review external guests' access to Teams every 90 days.

---

##   Entitlement Management (Deep Dive)

Entitlement Management provides:
- **Access packages** (bundled access rights to apps, groups, SharePoint sites)
- **Approval workflows** for requesting access
- **Automated expiration/removal**

> Use case: Contractors request an access package that expires automatically after 30 days.

---

##   PIM (Revisited)

PIM supports governance by:
- Limiting the duration of elevated access
- Requiring approval and justification for role activation
- Logging and auditing all privileged role use

##   Summary Table

| Capability                  | Purpose                                              |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Identity Protection         | Detect and mitigate identity-related threats        |
| Sign-in/User Risk           | Analyze login behavior and identity integrity       |
| Risk-Based Policies         | Automate blocking or challenging risky actions      |
| Identity Governance         | Manage and review access across users and systems   |
| Access Reviews              | Ensure ongoing access is necessary and appropriate  |
| Entitlement Management      | Streamline access to resources with packages        |
| Privileged Identity Mgmt    | Secure and govern admin role assignments            |

##   Real-World Example

> A healthcare org uses Entra Identity Protection to detect risky sign-ins from unfamiliar IPs and requires MFA for those attempts. PIM restricts admin rights to just-in-time windows, and access reviews are set up to audit internal and external collaborators monthly.
