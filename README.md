# Identity & Access Management Notes & Labs

This repository tracks my hands-on journey to mastering Identity & Access Management (IAM) — the backbone of modern cybersecurity and enterprise security strategy.

##   What’s Inside

- ✅ Detailed notes & documentation from hands-on learning
- ✅ Home labs and project-based learning using real-world terminology and IAM concepts
- ✅ A growing knowledge base covering authentication, access control, governance, zero trust, and more

##   Why I Created This

I’m focused on becoming an IAM Engineer — and this repo is my way of:

- Documenting and reinforcing what I learn
- Building a portfolio
- Showing consistent commitment and progress toward mastering IAM and modern identity solutions

##   In Progress

This repo will continue to grow as I complete:

- Microsoft Entra ID training and live projects
- Applied security and governance scenarios
- Self-directed and real-world labs beyond just Microsoft Learn

Let’s secure the future — one identity at a time.
