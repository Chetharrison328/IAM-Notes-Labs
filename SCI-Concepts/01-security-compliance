##   What is Security?

Security is about protecting your digital assets, devices, services, and data against cyber threats. This includes attacks from individuals, criminal organizations, or even nation-states.

Key Goals of Security:

- **Confidentiality** – Keeping data private and protected from unauthorized access
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered
- **Availability** – Making sure services and data are accessible when needed

##   What is Compliance?

Compliance refers to adhering to laws, regulations, standards, and organizational policies that define how data should be managed, stored, and protected.

Examples of regulations and standards:
- **GDPR** – General Data Protection Regulation (EU)
- **HIPAA** – Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (US healthcare)
- **NIST** – National Institute of Standards and Technology (US guidelines)
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – International information security standard

##   What's the Difference Between Security and Compliance?

| Concept     | Focus                                   | Purpose                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Security**   | Protection of data, systems, and users     | Prevent breaches and cyberattacks |
| **Compliance** | Following laws, regulations, and policies | Avoid legal and regulatory issues |

Note: **You can be compliant but not secure** if you're following rules but not actively defending your systems.

- Organizations must secure data to maintain trust and avoid penalties
- A strong security and compliance program supports both business continuity and customer confidence
