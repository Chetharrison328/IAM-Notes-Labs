# Module 2: Describe Identity Concepts

---

##   What Is Identity?

In cybersecurity, **identity** is the foundation of controlling access. It represents a unique person, device, application, or service that can be authenticated and authorized to use resources.

### Identity Types:

- **User identity** – Represents a person (e.g., employee, customer)
- **Device identity** – Tied to a physical or virtual device (e.g., laptops, mobile phones)
- **Workload identity** – Refers to applications and services running in cloud environments
- **Non-human identity (NHI)** – Bots, scripts, AI agents, and other automated processes

---

##   Why Identity Matters

- Identity is the **first line of defense** in protecting digital resources
- Everything starts with verifying “Who is making this request?”
- Modern environments rely on **identity-based access** instead of traditional perimeter defense

##   Identity Providers (IdPs)

An **Identity Provider (IdP)** is a service that manages, stores, and authenticates digital identities.

Common IdPs:
- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD / Entra ID)**
- **Google Identity**
- **Okta**
- **Ping Identity**

##   Identity Lifecycle

The **identity lifecycle** refers to the stages an identity goes through during its time in a system:

1. **Provisioning** – Creating a digital identity (e.g., onboarding an employee)
2. **Managing** – Updating roles, resetting passwords, enabling MFA, etc.
3. **Deprovisioning** – Disabling or deleting access when no longer needed (e.g., offboarding)

##   Identity Concepts in Practice

- Implementing **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for centralized authentication
- Enforcing **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for stronger login security
- Using **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to define what users can and can’t do
- Applying **conditional access** based on location, risk, device, and user behavior
