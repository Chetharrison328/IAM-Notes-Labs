# Perform Basic Identity & Access Tasks

## Title
Create, Configure, & Manage Identities Notes 

---

## Unit 1: Create, Configure & Manage Users

- Any user who needs access to Azure requires an **Azure user account**.
- A user account contains all the info needed to **authenticate** the user during sign-in.
- Once authenticated, **Microsoft Entra ID** builds an **access token** to authorize the user and determine what resources they can access and what actions they can take.
- You use the **Microsoft Entra ID dashboard** in the Azure portal to work with user objects.  
  ⚠️ You can only work with one directory at a time.

### Viewing Users
- Navigate to **Identity > Users > All Users** to view Microsoft Entra users.
- Three types of users in Microsoft Entra ID:
  1. **Cloud identities** – exist only in Microsoft Entra ID.
  2. **Directory-synchronized identities** – sourced from on-premises AD via Microsoft Entra Connect.
  3. **Guest users** – accounts from outside Azure (e.g., Xbox Live, external vendors, contractors).

## Unit 2: Restoring or Removing Deleted Users
- Deleted users remain in a **30-day suspended state** before permanent deletion.
- Permanently deleted users cannot be restored.

**Required Roles to Restore/Delete:**
- Global admin
- Partner Tier-1 Support
- Partner Tier-2 Support
- User admin

## Unit 3: Create, Configure & Manage Groups

- Microsoft Entra ID supports **rule-based membership** (e.g., by department or job title).

**Group Types:**
1. **Security groups** – manage member/computer access to shared resources.
2. **Microsoft 365 groups** – enable collaboration with shared mailbox, calendar, files, SharePoint, etc.

### Membership Types
- **Assigned** – manually added members.
- **Dynamic** – members added automatically based on rules.

**Dynamic Group Behavior:**
- Membership is generated by a formula each time the group is used.
- Users matching filter rules are automatically included.

## Unit 4: Configure & Manage Device Registration

**Goals:**
- Allow productivity on any device while protecting organizational assets.
- Use tools like **Microsoft Intune** for security and compliance.

**Microsoft Entra Registered Devices:**
- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) scenarios.
- Example: Rooted Android devices can be blocked via Intune compliance policies.

**Microsoft Entra Joined Devices:**
- For cloud-first or cloud-only orgs.
- Allows access to both cloud and on-prem resources.
- Useful for organizations transitioning to cloud-based infrastructure.

**Hybrid Microsoft Entra Joined Devices:**
- For orgs with on-prem AD + Microsoft Entra ID integration.
- Supports Group Policy, imaging, and older Windows versions.

**Device Writeback:**
- Enables conditional access for on-prem applications based on device status.
- Required for Windows Hello for Business in hybrid/federated setups.

## Unit 5: Manage Licenses

**Key Points:**
- Licenses (e.g., M365, EMS, Dynamics 365) are required per user.
- Group-based licensing simplifies large-scale management.
- One license per unique group member is required.

**Common Licensing Errors:**
1. **CountViolation** – Not enough licenses.
2. **MutuallyExclusiveViolation** – Conflicting service plans.
3. **DependencyViolation** – Missing prerequisite services.
4. **ProhibitedInUsageLocationViolation** – Service not available in user's location.

**Group Licensing Benefits:**
- Automatic updates on membership changes.
- Multiple product licenses can be assigned to the same group.

---

## Unit 6: Custom Security Attributes
- **Definition:** Business-specific attributes (key-value pairs) for Microsoft Entra objects.
- **Uses:** Extend user profiles, categorize apps/resources, enforce fine-grained access.

**Features:**
- Tenant-wide availability.
- Multiple data types: Boolean, integer, string.
- Single or multiple values.
- Predefined or free-form values.

---

## Unit 7: Automatic User Creation – SCIM

**Components:**
1. **HCM System** – HR systems.
2. **Microsoft Entra Provisioning Service** – Uses SCIM 2.0 protocol.
3. **Microsoft Entra ID** – Central user repository.
4. **Target System** – Application/system with SCIM endpoint.

**Benefits:**
- Automates user provisioning/de-provisioning.
- Synchronizes attributes between systems.
- Reduces security risks by ensuring timely deprovisioning.
