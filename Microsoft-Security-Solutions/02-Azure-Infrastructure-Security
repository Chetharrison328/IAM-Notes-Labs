# 02 - Describe Core Infrastructure Security Services in Azure

## Overview

Azure provides a wide range of infrastructure-level security services to protect resources, monitor traffic, and enforce policies across your cloud environment.

---

## Key Services and Concepts

###   Azure DDoS Protection

- Protects Azure-hosted applications from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- Monitors traffic in real-time and automatically mitigates threats.
- Two tiers: Basic (automatic) and Standard (custom policies, alerts, mitigation reports).

---

###   Azure Firewall

- A stateful, fully managed network security service.
- Central control over outbound and inbound traffic via rules.
- Supports threat intelligence-based filtering, logging, and integration with other Azure services.

---

###   Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- Protects web applications from common threats like SQL injection and XSS.
- Integrated with Azure Application Gateway, Front Door, and CDN.
- Uses OWASP Core Rule Sets (CRS) to define protection rules.

---

###   Network Security Groups (NSGs)

- Controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet and network interface level.
- Uses security rules (allow/deny) to enforce access policies.
- Simple but powerful method of segmentation in Azure networks.

---

###   Network Segmentation

- Strategy to divide a network into isolated segments.
- Limits the blast radius of attacks by minimizing lateral movement.
- Achieved using subnets, NSGs, firewalls, and private endpoints.

---

###   Azure Bastion

- Provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to Azure VMs without exposing them to the public internet.
- Fully managed and integrated with the Azure portal.
- Eliminates the need for jump servers and open ports on VMs.

---

###   Azure Key Vault

- Safeguards cryptographic keys, secrets, and certificates.
- Centralized management for secrets (API keys, passwords, connection strings).
- Supports auditing, RBAC, and integration with Azure services for secure deployments.

---

## Summary

These Azure infrastructure security services help build a secure, scalable, and resilient cloud environment. By combining NSGs, firewalls, Bastion, and Key Vault, organizations can enforce Zero Trust principles and protect against evolving threats.
