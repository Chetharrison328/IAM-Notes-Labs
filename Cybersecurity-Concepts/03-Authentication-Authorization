# Module 3: Describe Authentication & Authorization in Cybersecurity

---

##   What Is Authentication?

**Authentication** is the process of verifying that a person is who they claim to be.

**Example:**  
When a user logs into a system with a username and password, they are being authenticated.

###   Authentication Methods

Authentication methods are typically based on:

- **Something You Know**  
  - Passwords  
  - PINs  
  - Security Questions  

- **Something You Have**  
  - Identity Cards  
  - USB Keys  
  - Computers  
  - Smartphones  

- **Something You Are**  
  - Fingerprint  
  - Facial Recognition  
  - Retinal Scan  
  - Other Biometric ID  

>   **Note:** Biometric identification uses physical characteristics that uniquely identify an individual.

##   Single-Factor vs. Multi-Factor Authentication

| Type                         | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Single-Factor Authentication (SFA)** | Uses **only one** form of authentication. <br>ðŸ”¹ *Example: password only* |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  | Uses **two or more** different factors. <br>ðŸ”¹ *Example: PIN (know), phone (have), face scan (are)* |

##   Authentication-Based Attacks

Common attacks targeting authentication systems:

| Attack Type             | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force**          | Automated guessing of many password combinations. |
| **Dictionary Attack**    | Attempts logins using a list of common words or passwords. |
| **Credential Stuffing**  | Uses leaked credentials from other breaches to try logging in. |
| **Keylogging**           | Records keystrokes to steal information (usually via malware). |
| **Social Engineering**   | Manipulates people into revealing confidential data (includes phishing, pretexting, baiting). |

##   What Is Authorization?

**Authorization** determines what a user can access or do *after* theyâ€™ve been authenticated.

###   Authorization Techniques

| Technique                 | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Conditional Access**     | Access is based on specific conditions like location, device status, or risk level. |
| **Least Privileged Access**| Grants only the minimum access necessary for a user's role. |
| **Lateral Movement**       | After compromising one account, an attacker explores the system to gain further access. |
| **Zero Trust Security**    | Based on "never trust, always verify." Built on 3 core principles: <br>â€¢ Verify explicitly<br>â€¢ Use least privileged access<br>â€¢ Assume breach |
