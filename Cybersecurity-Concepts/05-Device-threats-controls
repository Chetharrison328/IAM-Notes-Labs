# Module 5: Describe Device-Based Threats and Security Controls

---

##   What Your Device Knows About You

Modern devices capture, store, and share sensitive information about us to stay connected and provide services.

###   Examples of Devices

- USB drives
- Printers
- Smart TVs
- Wi-Fi hotspots
- Car dashboards
- Smartphones, tablets, laptops

These devices often connect to other systems, making them both powerful tools and potential risk surfaces.

##   How Devices Become Cybersecurity Threats

###   Devices as Threat Vectors

| Device Type      | Potential Threat |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Phone/Laptop/Tablet** | Downloading malicious apps |
| **USB Drive**           | Malware hidden in files or firmware |
| **Smart Assistants**    | Always listening or recording without your knowledge |

###   Device Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability                       | Description |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Outdated Software**              | Missing critical security patches |
| **Weak Authentication**            | No PIN, password, or biometric protection |
| **Jailbroken Devices**             | Removed OS restrictions leave devices exposed |
| **Untrusted Wi-Fi Hotspots**       | Public networks can be easily compromised by attackers |

Example: Connecting to airport Wi-Fi without protection makes your device an easy target.

##   How to Mitigate Device-Related Threats

###   Device Hardening Techniques

- Keep all devices **up to date** with the latest security patches.
- **Turn off** unused features or devices (e.g., Bluetooth, voice assistants).
- Enable OS-level **security features**.
- Require **PINs**, **passwords**, or **biometrics** (fingerprint, face scan).

###   Encryption

- Encrypt data at rest so that if the device is stolen, the information remains unintelligible without a key.

###   Limit Application and Device Access

Example: Leaving your device unlocked can allow unauthorized access to your accounts or apps.
