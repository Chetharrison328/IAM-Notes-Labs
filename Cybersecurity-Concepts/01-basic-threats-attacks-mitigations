## Cybersecurity Overview

**Cybersecurity** refers to the technologies, processes, and training used to protect systems, networks, programs, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or attack.

### Goals of Cybersecurity (CIA Triad)
- **Confidentiality** – Prevent unauthorized data access.
- **Integrity** – Ensure data accuracy and trustworthiness.
- **Availability** – Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed.

---

## Cyberattacks

A `cyberattack` is an attempt to gain illegal or unauthorized access to a system, network, or data in order to cause damage or disruption.

### Attack Methods
Attackers may use:
- People (social engineering)
- Devices (computers, phones)
- Applications and messages
- System processes

### Attack Objectives
- Encrypt or lock data (ransom)
- Destroy or delete critical files
- Steal sensitive information
- Publicly leak private data
- Interrupt vital operations

---

## Cybercriminals

A `cybercriminal` can be:
- An individual or group
- A criminal-for-hire organization
- A government-sponsored entity

> Note: Cybercriminals often operate globally and anonymously.

---

## Threat Landscape

The `threat landscape` refers to all potential vulnerabilities and entry points for cyberattacks within an organization’s digital ecosystem.

### Examples of Threat Surfaces
- Email and social media accounts
- Mobile devices
- Cloud services
- Technology infrastructure
- Employees and insiders

---

## Attack Vectors

An `attack vector` is a specific path or method used to gain access to a system or network.

### Common Vectors
- **Email** (phishing)
- **Removable media** (USB drives)
- **Web browsers**
- **Cloud-based applications**
- **Internal actors** (malicious or negligent insiders)

---

## Security and Data Breaches

### Security Breach

A `security breach` occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a system, service, or network.

#### Examples:
- **Social engineering** – Manipulating users to reveal credentials or provide access.
- **Browser attacks** – Fake websites trick users into entering sensitive data.
- **Password attacks** – Brute-force or credential-stuffing attempts on login forms.

### Data Breach

A `data breach` happens when attackers access or steal confidential information.

> Breaches are often the goal of a security exploit, as data holds critical value to businesses and individuals.

## Malware: Types and Components

`Malware` (malicious software) is code designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a system.

### Core Components:
- **Propagation mechanism** – How malware spreads
- **Payload** – What the malware does

### Propagation Techniques
- **Virus** – Requires user action (e.g., opening infected file)
- **Worm** – Self-spreading without user interaction
- **Trojan** – Disguised as legitimate software; performs malicious actions behind the scenes

### Payload Examples
- **Ransomware** – Locks data/systems until ransom is paid
- **Spyware** – Monitors user activity to steal info
- **Backdoors** – Bypass security to maintain access
- **Botnets** – Convert devices into part of a remotely controlled network

---

## Mitigation Strategies

A `mitigation strategy` is a proactive measure used to prevent, detect, or reduce the impact of cyberattacks.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Requires users to provide two or more forms of verification:
- Something you know (password)
- Something you have (phone or token)
- Something you are (biometric)

### Browser Security Controls
Organizations can:
- Prevent unauthorized extensions
- Allow only approved browsers
- Block known-malicious websites
- Enforce updates

### User Education
Train users to:
- Identify phishing or suspicious messages
- Avoid giving out personal info
- Lock unattended devices
- Follow data handling policies

### Threat Intelligence
Use systems that collect and analyze:
- Security logs
- Known vulnerabilities
- Past attack patterns

This helps inform better threat detection and incident response.
