# Module 4: Describe Network-Based Threats and Mitigations

---

##   What Is a Network?

A **network** is a grouping of interconnected physical components that allow devices to communicate with each other.

###   Key Network Devices

- **Switch** – Enables multiple devices to communicate on the same network.
- **Router** – Connects different networks together and manages traffic between them.

---

##   Types of Networks

| Network Type      | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Private Network** | Requires authentication and authorization to access devices/resources. |
| **Public Network**  | Open to any user (e.g., the Internet). |

---

##   Ways to Connect to a Network

- **Wired (Ethernet) Connection**
- **Wireless (Wi-Fi) Connection**
- **Bluetooth Connection**

---

##   Client-Server Topology

In this model, a **client** is a device or application that makes requests, and a **server** is the system that fulfills them.

---

##   How Data Moves Around a Network

Network communication is governed by the **TCP/IP protocol suite**.

###   Data Packets

All data is broken into uniform chunks called **packets** (or datagrams) for transmission.

###   IP Address

Each device is assigned a unique IP address, like `127.100.0.1`.

- **IPv4** – Most commonly used (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
- **IPv6** – Newer standard to accommodate more devices

###   DNS (Domain Name System)

Translates user-friendly domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses.

###   Routing

If a device’s IP address is outside your network, a **router** sends the traffic to the right external network.

##   Network Security Threats

### Common Network Attacks

| Attack Type                     | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**    | An attacker secretly intercepts or alters communication between two parties. |
| **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** | Overwhelms a target system with traffic to disrupt its normal operation. |

---

### DNS-Based Attacks

| Attack Type           | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **DNS Poisoning**      | Corrupts the DNS cache so users are redirected to malicious websites. |

---

### Wireless Attacks

| Attack Type              | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Wardriving**            | Driving around with a device to find insecure wireless networks. |
| **Spoofed Wi-Fi Hotspots**| Attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi access point to steal data or credentials. |

---

### Bluetooth-Based Attacks

| Attack Type    | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Bluejacking** | Sends unsolicited messages to nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. |

---

##   Network Protection Techniques

###   Firewall

Acts as a **barrier** between your internal network and the Internet. Filters traffic based on security rules.

###   Antivirus

Runs in the background to **scan** and **block** malicious files and software entering the system.

###   Network Access Control (NAC)

A policy-based solution that controls access to the network by enforcing identity and security rules.

###  Network Segmentation

Splits a network into **isolated segments** to minimize the impact of potential breaches.

###   VPN (Virtual Private Network)

Encrypts and anonymizes internet traffic to ensure **private and secure** communication over public networks.

###   Wireless Network Encryption

- **WPA2** is the current Wi-Fi security standard.
- Uses **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** to secure wireless traffic.
