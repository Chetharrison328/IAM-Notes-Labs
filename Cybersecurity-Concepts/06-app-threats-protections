# Module 6: Describe Application-Based Threats and How to Protect Against Them

---

##  What Are Applications?

###   What Is Software?

Software is a collection of commands (code) that instruct a computer or device to perform specific tasks.

There are two major types of software:

###   System Software

- First software to run when the device powers on
- Controls or facilitates hardware and system processes
- Runs independently in the background (e.g., OS kernel)

###   Application Software

- Designed for a specific user or task
- Requires system software to function
- Installed and managed by the user
- Provides direct interaction with the user
- Example: browsers, word processors, mobile apps

##   Threat Landscape of Applications

###   Applications from Untrustworthy Origins

- Apps downloaded outside of verified app stores may contain malware
- Not all app stores screen apps as thoroughly as Apple or Google Play

###   Inherent Vulnerabilities in Applications

| Vulnerability        | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Open-source libraries** | Public code is accessible and modifiableâ€”while many contribute for good, some exploit vulnerabilities to steal data |
| **Zero-day vulnerabilities** | Flaws that are unknown to the application owner but actively exploited by attackers before patches are released |

###   Browser-Based Threats

| Threat Type          | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Cookie-based attacks** | Cookies are plaintext files containing user credentials, preferences, etc. A common threat is **session replay** (reusing valid session data) |
| **Typosquatting**     | Attackers register misspelled versions of popular domains to trick users into visiting malicious sites disguised as legitimate ones |

##   How to Protect Your Applications

###   Patching Promptly

- Application updates include security patches to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities
- Cybercriminals exploit even small windows of opportunity between discovery and patch application

###   Application Configuration

- Default settings often enable broad access and may include default passwords or accounts
- Always **review and secure default configurations** immediately after installation

###   Privacy Settings

- Clear your history, location data, and usage patterns regularly
- Example: Delete saved routes from navigation apps after use

###   Cookie Management

- Regularly clear browser cookies to reduce risk of session hijacking or data leaks

###   Use Verified Applications

- Avoid third-party or lookalike apps designed to imitate legitimate software
- Only download from **trusted** and **verified** sources (official stores, reputable vendors)
